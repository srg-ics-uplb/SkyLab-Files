\section{Introduction}

Cloud computing has marked significant developments and possibilities in the industry. It focuses on offering services for the different needs of the modern society.


There are three categories of cloud computing services namely, Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Organizations provide Saas depending on the demand. Google Apps is one example of SaaS that can be used to manage email and create documents, etc. PaaS offers developers a platform where they can build and deploy applications. IaaS provides storage, servers and clusters. These tools are primarily created to serve computational needs \cite {Ahuja2012}. A cloud computing platform dynamically allocates, configures, reconfigures and deallocates servers as requested or on demand. This approach ensures the elasticity of cloud computing \cite {Brandic2011}.


Most scientific applications require high performance computing (HPC) which needs CPU intensive computations and large data storage. To be able to host such applications, several computers interconnected in a network such as clusters are needed. This makes scientific computing very costly in terms of hardware infrastructure investment. With the advancement in cloud computing, these scientific applications  can be deployed in the cloud without worrying about hardware costs and maintenance \cite {Ahuja2012}. However, studies have shown that network transmission delay is the major drawback in deploying HPC applications in the cloud\cite {Brandic2011}. 


Peak-Two Cloud (P2C) is a private cloud based on OpenStack designed for research in deploying HPC applications in the cloud\cite {Hermocilla2014}. One of the features introduced by P2C is vCluster. vCluster is a tool that enables a user to deploy a working (Message Passing Interface) cluster on demand and to terminate it after use. P2C has been used by researchers in various fields including bioinformatics, quantum chemistry, and molecular dynamics. These researchers belong to different research groups who have no investment in HPC infrastructure due to limited funding but requires computing for their research. However, vCluster is a comman line application which make it difficult for non-technical users (scientists and researchers) to use. A more user-friendly interface is needed in order to enable scientists to focus more on their science rather than on the command line.

To address this, we developed SkyLab in order to ease the burden of the users in learning the command line.


Creating a web application that would host vCluster with additional features like graphical representation to visualize trends, and a Graphical User Interface(GUI) to offer convenient access. This paper will present SkyLab, a web application that aims to serve and to improve vCluster functionalities.

This study will help us visualize how HPC applications can be hosted in the cloud and understand why is this technology timely relevant.  Even with capable hardware, computations might take hours or even days which makes it a hassle for users. Thus, there is a need for a more convenient way of access for HPC applications. Furthermore, this would encourage students to explore and research on HPC applications. HPC applications usually have a plain numerical output. A means of presenting data graphically would make the interpretation of data more efficient.

The study would contribute to research on hosting HPC applications in the cloud. Problems encountered and solutions offered throughout the study will give insights to future researchers. Furthermore, the output application of the study can be used by the academe.

The study focuses on vCluster and is not mainly concerned on P2C as a whole. The study initially bases on the current implementation of vCluster and eventually improve it and offer additional features\cite {Hermocilla2014}.

This study aims to develop SkyLab, a web application that would function as a front-end for vCluster. 	Specifically, it should be able to: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item allow users to select tools and execute them via web interface; 
        \item create an extensible platform that would accommodate additional tools; and
		\item display output data of tools.
	\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Functional Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Users can upload input data to the server.
    	\item Users can view the results of the used tools.
    	\item The system is integrated with vCluster functionalities.
    \end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Non-functional Requirements}
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Users must be authenticated to be able to use the system.
       	\item The system must be easy to use and user friendly.
       	\item The system must be highly maintainable for future development.  
	\end{itemize}
        
\section {Related Work}


Ganglia is a system designed to monitor high performance computing systems. It uses a hierarchical model in managing the system of clusters. It uses optimized data structures and communication algorithms to achieve scalability with high concurrency. It is claimed to be used by over 500 clusters around the world. This implies that the system is tested and trusted to be used for real-world applications\cite{1395654820040701}.
	    
One of the main inspirations for developing SkyLab is the Yabi system. It provides a web interface with support for workflow environments with focus on introducing HPC applications to non-technical audience. Users can create and reuse workflows, and manage large amounts of data while system administrators can configure tools via the web interface as well. It is currently in use by multiple institutions, and is maintained as an open-source project\cite{7411021620120101}.	    	    
	    
Another related project is Web Interface for mpiBLAST (WImpiBLAST). It supports mpiBLAST, a parallel implementation of Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). BLAST is a software used for sequence homology similarity search in large databases of gene sequences. mpiBLAST can utilize HPC clusters to achieve faster computing speeds but it requires knowledge in using MPI commands to benefit from its advantages. WImpiBLAST addresses this problem by providing the user a web interface to simplify the steps to use mpiBLAST\cite{9686120720140601}.   
            
        
\section{Design and Implementation}

\subsection{System Architecture}
SkyLab functions as a web front-end for vCluster which is built on top of Peak-Two Cloud.

      \caption{Use Case Diagram of SkyLab}\label{System Architecture}
    \end{figure*}

\subsection{MPI clusters} 

The system spawns a thread (MPIThread) for each active cluster which handles the connection to the assigned cluster via Secure Shell (SSH). Creation and deletion of clusters is done by using vCluster commands while tool activation is done by using p2c-tools. The thread also manages task queuing and execution.
		
A cluster is either classified as public or private. If it is set to public, every user in the system can use it. On the other hand, for private clusters, the cluster will only be visible to the owner. The owner has the option to share the cluster to other users via the share key generated for the said cluster. 		

\subsection{Tool sets} 
The system searches for Python packages inside the assigned modules folder and install it on server start. The tool sets will then be available for use with the system. The package must have a Python module named \emph{install.py} which contains function calls for integrating the package with the system. The package must also contain the corresponding views and executable classes for each sub-tool.  

\subsection{Tasks} 
The system creates a task object for each task input by the user. A signal will then be sent and it is then received by the corresponding MPIThread which queues the task for execution. When a task is executed, it calls the assigned executable class with the given parameters. On connection error, the task waits exponentially before retrying. If the server crashes while running task execution, the task is just restarted.				
		
Default task execution flow via executable class:			
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item  Needed remote and local directories for execution are cleared or created.
		\item  Input files are uploaded to cluster.
		\item  List of commands given are executed.
		\item  Output files are sent back to the server.
		\item  Remote task folder is deleted.
		\item  Output files are served by the server.
	\end{enumerate}	

	
\subsection{Technologies}
	\begin{itemize}
   		\item Programming Language: Python 
   		\item Web Framework: Django  
   		\item DBMS: MariaDB  
   		\item Cloud Infrastructure: Peak-Two Cloud

			\captionof{figure}{Results of QUIS for SkyLab}			
	\end{center}
	The system has been evaluated by 56 respondents by answering a survey based on Questionnaire for User Interface Satisfaction (QUIS) \cite{chin1988development}. Respondents are students who are unfamiliar with both HPC tools and the concept of MPI systems.  Respondents are asked to test features of SkyLab by following a set of instructions and using input files provided. On the average, the users rated their overall experience with SkyLab to 6.9/10. The users listed the simplicity of the user interface to be the most positive aspect of the system while the slow speed of task processing is said to be the most negative. Majority of the tools supported by SkyLab have inherently long processing time which is not known to the respondents. The system does not focus on optimizing the said tools to achieve better performance but rather it focuses on simplifying the user's task submission process. 

	
\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
The system created allows users to manage MPI clusters and submit tasks without the need for technical expertise in scripting. This makes the advantages of HPC available to non-technical users. This is achieved by parsing form inputs to generate commands for task execution. Task files can be download from the server and output files are displayed with the help of JSmol\cite{IJCH:IJCH201300024}. The system is also configured to install tool sets found in the modules folder making it possible to accommodate additional tools. Based on the user acceptance test conducted, the users found the system to be acceptable in terms of the criteria provided, in general. 

The system achieved its main objectives but its features can still be improved and additional features can be introduced. Improved input parameter checking and error handling will make the system more robust. There are still use cases of tools that are yet to be supported. Input file generation can make the process more interactive and more customizable.  Workflow design support will enable users to run complex tasks. Support for custom MPI programs will make it easier for developers to utilize the system as a test environment. Task scheduling and resource management algorithms can be used to efficiently handle resource-intensive or time consuming tasks. For example, a cluster can borrow resources from idle clusters. These recommendations will provide the users a better experience in using the system for academic and research purposes.
